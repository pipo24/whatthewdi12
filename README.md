#WDI Hackaton:  WhattheWDI

##Preparation:

###Scope:

    Have fun in a 24hrs hackaton - and practice some JS. 
  We nailed the first and lazied up on the second :sweat_smile:
  
###Scope:

The game: a compilation of the class's memes, inside jokes, a pictures of nice memories. 

###Inspiration:

From [whatthefuckismymashup](http://whatthefuckismymashup.com/ "whatthefuckismymashup"), engine from: [WTFEngine](https://github.com/soulwire/WTFEngine "WTFEngine")
